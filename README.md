# Building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from Scratch in Python for synthesizing text

In this project, I delve into the realm of natural language processing (NLP) by constructing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) entirely from scratch using NumPy. My goal is to train this RNN on a given text dataset (in this case, a sample from Harry Potter) and then use it to generate new text that mimics the style and structure of the original text

#### Why from scratch?

While there are powerful deep learning libraries available like TensorFlow and PyTorch, understanding the mechanics of an RNN at this level can be immensely beneficial. Building an RNN from scratch offers a deep understanding of its inner workings. By implementing the core functionalities myself, I gain insights into the fundamental concepts of sequence modeling, backpropagation, and gradient descent optimization.
